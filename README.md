# Membangun Sistem Machine Learning
# Churn Prediction System

* Developed a full ML pipeline to predict customer churn using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
* Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
* Implemented MLOps workflow using MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry.
* Deployed the trained model via REST API using Flask and served it with Docker containers.
* Built monitoring dashboard with Prometheus and Grafana to track prediction latency, request count, and model performance.
* Outcome: Achieved 95% accuracy and deployed an end-to-end system simulating a real-world use case.
